# Traveling-Salesman-AStar-Algorithm
A program solving the traveling salesman's problem using A* search.

Input#1: a text file of an undirected graph represented by a list of bidirectional edges with costs [Ni, Nj, C]. The first line of text is the "number of nodes N" in graph G, follow by a list of triplets [Ni, Nj, C].

Input#2: starting node (user input)

Input#3: which h* function to compute the h* value (either 1/2/3 by user input)

Output#1: the result of A* search of a "simple path" that begins and end at the start node. Below are the results to be shown:
1. input graph
2. start node specified
3. result of "simple path" (a list of edges) [Ni, Nj, C] starting from node # using A* search.
4. total cost of the "simple path"

Output#2: Debugging results
