Below is the input graph for this program.
3  4  24
1  2  50
2  3  30
1  4  80
1  3  20
2  4  40

The starting node is 1.
The HFunction used is 3

Below is the result of the simple-path with a list of edges starting from node 1.
START:-->1-->3-->4-->2-->1
1	3	20
3	4	24
4	2	40
2	1	50

The total cost of the simple-path is 134.
